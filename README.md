Hi, I am Charlotte. ðŸ™ƒ

I am not a writer so I've copied and pasted my LinkedIn Intro here:
"Experienced Traffic & Safety Supervisor ensures safe and smooth train traffic in a busy, ever-changing environment. Driven to constantly learn and take on new challenges. Finds appropriate solutions in problem situations. Possesses an educational background as a Bachelor of Orthopedagogy. Started in 2023 on a new big challenge: a degree in Applied Computer Science."

I want to learn how to code and develop software! ðŸ¤“
